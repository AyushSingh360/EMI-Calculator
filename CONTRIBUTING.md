## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the EMI for a given loan amount, interest rate, and tenure
 * @param principal - The loan amount
 * @param annualRate - Annual interest rate as percentage
 * @param months - Loan tenure in months
 * @returns Monthly EMI amount
 */
export const calculateEMI = (
  principal: number, 
  annualRate: number, 
  months: number
): number => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error boundaries

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onAction: (value: string) => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
  title, 
  onAction, 
  isLoading = false 
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design
- Test in both light and dark modes

```tsx
<div className={`
  backdrop-blur-md rounded-2xl border shadow-xl transition-all duration-300
  ${isDarkMode 
    ? 'bg-gray-800/80 border-gray-700' 
    : 'bg-white/80 border-gray-200'
  }
`}>
```

### File Organization

- Keep components in `src/components/`
- Place utilities in `src/utils/`
- Add types to `src/types/`
- Follow existing folder structure

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

```typescript
describe('calculateEMI', () => {
  it('should calculate correct EMI for valid inputs', () => {
    const result = calculateEMI(100000, 10, 12);
    expect(result).toBeCloseTo(8791.59, 2);
  });

  it('should handle zero interest rate', () => {
    const result = calculateEMI(100000, 0, 12);
    expect(result).toBe(8333.33);
  });
});
```
